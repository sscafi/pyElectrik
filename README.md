# Physics Simulator README

===========================

Welcome to the Physics Simulator, a comprehensive tool for simulating various physical phenomena, including electrical circuits and systems. This simulator is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring and understanding complex physical concepts.

## Features

---

- Simulate electrical circuits, including series RC and parallel RL circuits
- Explore Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, and Kirchhoff's Current Law
- Use a variety of electrical components, including resistors, capacitors, and inductors
- Input values for circuit components and time to simulate circuit behavior
- View results in a clear and concise format

## Getting Started

---

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/sscafi/physics-simulator.git`
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the simulator using `python main.py`

## Usage

---
